CS 169 Let's Carpool Backend

Must create carpool database, syncdb, schemamigrate, and migrate model information into the database before testing locally. 
Also be sure to import the information from the "scratch" file... this process will eventually be automated.
To run this server locally use the following command:
python manage.py runserver 

To see our heroku instance running the current code, go to:
http://young-tor-7977.herokuapp.com/

To run our test-suite use the following command:
python manage.py test carpoolapp

Viewing the resulting output and server response will help to elucidate what is happening if coming across issues
